I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [University of Virginia]([https://www.virginia.edu/]), supervised by [Prof. Tianhao Wang]([https://tianhao.wang/]). Before that, I obtained my bachelor’s degree at Southwest Jiaotong University.

I'm always open to collaboration and would love to explore any fascinating topics together. Feel free to reach out to me at [email](mailto:trv3px@virginia.edu)—I'm excited to learn from you!  

**<span style="color:red">*I'm actively seeking a 2025 summer internship and would be grateful for your support!*</span>**


## Research Interests

- Safety of Image/Video Generation Models
- Machine learning Privacy and Security
